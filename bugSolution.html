The solution is to avoid using `@apply` for classes with pseudo-selectors.  Apply the classes directly:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded focus:outline-none focus:shadow-outline">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This approach ensures that the styles associated with the pseudo-selectors (`hover`, `focus`) are applied correctly.  The `@apply` directive can be used for other classes without pseudo-selectors.
